thanks basil. i just want to give you a bit of an insight into the saturday afternoon team. we’re a bunch of unique individuals – malthouse, harley, zempilas, mclachlan and myself. we’re gonna engage with our minds and our hearts. we’re gonna exchange ideas, thoughts and even our energy. and to speak from your heart you need to have courage. you need to be honest and authentic. we’re not always gonna get it right. and sometimes, you’re not going to agree with us. but that’s okay, because just like you we care. just like you, we’re passionate about the game. so if you want to come along for the ride, join us on saturday arvos, because we just love the footy.
