Imagen has been my partner for about eight months as of writing this.
We have been through a lot. Immy‘s [[nicotine addiction|nicotine addiction]]  Brought around by [[disposable vaporiser pens|disposable vaporiser pens]]. Me buying them weed. Then talking about their extreme jealousy towards their siblings. Their mother throwing them out of the house and then losing all of that stuff. And what’s currently happening with acid use.
